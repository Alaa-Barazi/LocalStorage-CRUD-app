# LocalStorage-CRUD-app <br/>
The following exercise contains the following subjects: <br/>
● CRUD <br/>
● useState <br/>
● useEffect <br/>
● localStorage <br/>

Let's create a very basic todo app using useState.  <br/>
The user can write a task and add it to the existing list.  <br/>
Each task is initially marked as uncompleted.  <br/>
To change the task from incomplete to complete, the user has  <br/>
to click on the task itself or the icon.  <br/>
In addition, next to each task there will be a delete button that  <br/>
will remove it from the list.  <br/>
We would like to use localStorage so that the information will  <br/>
not be lost if we leave the page.  <br/>


<h2>CRUD </h2><br/>
 <h3> Read:</h3> <br/>
  When the application comes up, check if there is a list of todos <br/>
  in localStorage and if so, save it in the state and display it. <br/>
 <h3> Create:</h3> <br/>
  If the user adds a task we will add it to our todosArr state, and <br/>
  update the localStorage. <br/>
  <h3>Update:</h3> <br/>
  If the user updates a task from incomplete to complete. We <br/>
  would like to iterate over the todosArr and change only the task <br/>
  we clicked on.<br/>
  Then we'll save the update in the state and the localStorage.<br/>
 <h3> Delete: </h3><br/>
  If the user deletes a task. We would like to iterate over the<br/>
  todosArr and filter the task we clicked on.<br/>
  Then we'll save the update in the state and the localStorage.<br/>
